                    <p>AFI 31-101 directs the designation of an approved automated Integrated Defense Risk Management Process (IDRMP) application to facilitate the ID risk management process. In June 2018, the "DoD Antiterrorism" module of EPRM was fielded at several Air Force installations to evaluate its ability to satisfy IDRMP requirements.  AF/A4S identified  many changes that were incorporated into the current IDRMP module.</p>

                            <p>No, you have to complete an assessment to track your vulnerabilities.</p>
                            <p>In the previous AT vulnerability management system (CVAMP), all vulnerabilities &apos;should&apos; have been associated with a local or HHQ assessment.  However, in practice, many commands would put in &apos;ad hoc&apos; observations/vulnerabilities.  Those entries, though somewhat useful, were of limited value at HHQ because they could not be viewed in the context of the other protections that were in-place and the totality of the risk resulting from that vulnerability.</p>
                            <p>Now, when an assessment is entered, commands will document the protections in-place and those that are not by responding to the list of relevant DoD Benchmarks (like with ForcePRO).  For those protections that are not in-place (i.e. the benchmark is not being met), commands can propose mitigation.  All vulnerabilities will thereby be associated with the DoD benchmark to which they are most closely related, for tracking and reporting purposes.  Enforcing the need to address vulnerabilities as part of an overall assessment, allows each vulnerability to be viewed more completely within the context of the risk (asset/threat/vulnerability) at the installation.</p>

                                <li>Within the system, when you look at the hierarchy if your installation has any TCAs that were imported from the authoritative database (SMADS) they will already be listed with their tier level. To find them, you can search SMADS on the hierarchy either as the node manager (&quot;Node Management&quot;) or on the screen that comes up right after you select &quot;Start Assessment&quot;.</li>
                                <li>Consult with the installations operations department which will have access to the list of TCAs in either SMADS or AF-CAMs. You will typically find the POC for the systems to be the Critical Asset Risk Management (CARM) program manager who also has access to Critical Asset Identification Process (CAIP) documents.</li>

In preparation for the Mission Assurance Assessment Module (MAA) those TCAs/ TAs have been added to the EPRM hierarchy from the Strategic Mission Assurance Data System (SMADS). These items are for the MAA module and should be left as is.</p>
