                    <p>
                        The EPRM Command Cyber Readiness Inspection (CCRI) Assessment Module enables the USAF cyber community, as well as DoD Services and Agencies, to be inspection-ready at all times via access to a self-managed tool that feeds the following processes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The online DODIN Inspection Scoping Workbook (ISW) in EPRM will exist as the official tool of record for elements of the CCRI phase 2 pre-inspection and scoping process.</li>
                        <li>The assessment capability within EPRM will utilize elements of CCRI phase 3 and present standardized checklists that guide a CCRI team or installation-level POC through a pre-CCRI, self-assessment.</li>
                        <li>The continuous monitoring capability within EPRM will utilize elements of CCRI phase 4 and allow installation-level POCs or assessment teams to create a Plan of Action &amp; Milestones (POA&M) following self-inspection.</li>
                        <li>Service/Agency senior leadership and CCRI Team leads will have read only visibility into the pre-inspection and scoping process in EPRM, with the potential for visibility into the self-assessment and monitoring processes, as needed.</li>
