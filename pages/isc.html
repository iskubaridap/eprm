                    <p><strong>As the Department of Defense&apos;s (DoD) software solution provider for ISC assessment and analysis</strong>, the DoD sponsored CounterMeasures® Risk analysis software is Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Interagency Security Committee (ISC) certified.

                <div>
                    <p>Events such as the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and the 2015 Chattanooga shootings demonstrate the threat posed to federal office buildings not located on a military site. On October 19, 1995, six months after the Oklahoma City bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, Executive Order (EO) 12977 created the ISC to establish standardized protection criteria for all federal facilities. The DHS’s ISC standards are intended to ensure that security measures consider likely threats against federal resources and employees and incorporate appropriate protection, such as stand-off distances and pop-up vehicle barriers. </p>

                <div>
                    <p>“In accordance with DoD Instruction 2000.12, all leased facility space or space in buildings owned or operated by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) not located on DoD property must comply with the security standards established by the Interagency Security Committee (ISC) in The Risk Management Process for Federal Facilities: An Interagency Security Committee Standard.  The ISC standard must additionally be applied to leased space not on DoD property in foreign countries. Facility space leased prior to 7 December 2012 must comply with the ISC standards to the extent practicable in accordance with existing lease agreements  UFC 4-010-01 DoD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards For Buildings, para 1-6.4

                    <p>EPRM administers the ISC Risk Management Process (RMP) and presents results in one simple analysis by establishing a baseline Level of Protection. This allows users to realign protection resources to mitigate their most severe risks. The ISC RMP is intended to be applied to all buildings and facilities occupied by Federal employees for nonmilitary activities including:</p>
